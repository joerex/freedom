                      <p>Dronevictory.com was produced independently by a small group of empowered patriots. Help us maintain and advance the feverish excitement of the globatron stadium by donating to the cause. We are working on turning this site into a phone app so every man, woman, and child can keep a piece of our war on terror in their pocket at all times. No strike should ever go uncelebrated! Donate to the cause and stay tuned!</p>

                      <p>Join our great nation in celebrating the undeniable heroism and progress of the US DRONE PROGRAM in the futuristic globatron stadium as it leads the world on a path to global peace, one strike at a time.</p>
                      <p>Our drones are flying high above the middle east, facing the most devilishly evil villains in our nation's history, but our great drones do not cower in the face of terror! They bravely venture deep into the unknown, with laser precision, risking everything to protect our freedoms back home. It is our duty as citizens, no, as patriots, to celebrate our drones, to cheer for our champions on their quest for greatness, and to keep score of our war on terror in our blazing path towards victory!</p>
                      <p>No strike should ever go unnoticed, it's time to give our drones the credit they deserve! </p>
